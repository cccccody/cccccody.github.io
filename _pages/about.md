I am a recent graduate of the Master's in Mathematics in Finance program from NYU Courant, and I am currently a junior research scientist at NYU Stern's Finance department working with Prof. Robert Richmond and Prof. Toomas Laarits. I will be starting my PhD in Finance at UCLA Anderson School of Business this fall. Here's my latest [CV](https://www.dropbox.com/s/995oeq10lpo1ook/CV_Nov2022.pdf?dl=0)

I'm interested in asset pricing broadly, with a focus on market microstructure, volatility, and intersections with financial intermediaries and macro-finance. I'm also interested in applications of statistics and machine learning in finance, such as text analysis.

I play a little guitar and keyboard on the side, and dabble in pop-singing.
