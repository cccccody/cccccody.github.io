Born and raised in Jiangsu, China, I have adopted the name `Cody` when I first started learning English at a young age. My legal first name is 正清 (Hanyu Pinyin: zheng4 qing1, Wade-Giles: Cheng Ch'ing) and my last name is 万 (Wan4). I am a recent graduate of the Master's in Mathematics in Finance program from NYU Courant.
