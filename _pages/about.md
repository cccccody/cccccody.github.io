I am a recent graduate of the Master's in Mathematics in Finance program from NYU Courant, and I am currently a junior research scientist at NYU Stern's Finance department. 

About My Name
------
Born and raised in Jiangsu, China, I hand-picked the name `Cody` blindfoled from a box of name slips at my first English summer camp at age 12, which has proven quite helpful to my non-mandarin speaking friends. My legal first name is 正清 (Hanyu Pinyin: zheng4 qing1, Wade-Giles: Cheng Ch'ing) and my family name is 万 (Wan4).
