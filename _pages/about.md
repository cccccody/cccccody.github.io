I am a first year PhD student in the Finance department at UCLA's Anderson School of Management. Before that, I was a junior research scientist at NYU Stern's Finance department and a graduate of the Master's in Mathematics in Finance program from NYU Courant. Here's my [CV](https://www.dropbox.com/s/6f7lwrafb5z7gg3/CV_Nov2022_public.pdf?dl=0)

I'm interested in asset pricing broadly, with a focus on market microstructure, volatility, and leveraged products in financial markets.

I play a little guitar and keyboard on the side, and dabble in pop-singing.
