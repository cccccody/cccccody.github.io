I am a recent graduate of the Master's in Mathematics in Finance program from NYU Courant, and I have accepted a Junior Research Scientist position at NYU Stern that starts in summer 2021. 

About My Name
------
Born and raised in Jiangsu, China, I have adopted the name `Cody` when I first started learning English at a young age, which has proven quite helpful to my foreign friends. My legal first name is 正清 (Hanyu Pinyin: zheng4 qing1, Wade-Giles: Cheng Ch'ing) and my last name is 万 (Wan4).
